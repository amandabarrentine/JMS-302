        <p>Unblight is a recent project collaboration between Mercer University's <b>Center for Collaborative Journalism</b> and the <b>Sunlight Foundation</b>, funded by the <b>John S. and James L. Knight Foundation</b>.</p>
        <p>Blight is a problem that affects every city in the world. But not many people know what it actually is. The Unblight project is meant to bring awareness to the people, as well as to bring together great minds to try to solve the problem of blight.</p>
        <p>The questions that this problem raises are simple, and the Center is working on a mapping study to figure out the effects of blight in Mercer's own Macon, Ga.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><i>Why should we care?</i> As stated above, blight affects every city, in ways that officials may not even be aware of. In Macon alone, there are an estimated 4,000 uninhabited houses. Think about how that number would be different in a larger city like Atlanta.</li>
        <li><i>Why not just demolish?</i> Though this may seem like an appealing option, Mayor Robert Reichert says that path could lead to 40 years worth of demolition-- not an ideal option for anyone. A hosue scheduled for demolition has to be inspected for asbestos and other environmental hazards before it can be destroyed, and the process takes anywhere from $12,000 to $15,000, as well as a length of two to five years.</li>
        </ul>
